"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept "
"of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple "
"string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable "
"data-type as cookie value."

"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the :rfc:"
"`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered that "
"MSIE 3.0x didn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs; many "
"current-day browsers and servers have also relaxed parsing rules when it "
"comes to cookie handling.  As a result, this module now uses parsing rules "
"that are a bit less strict than they once were."
